Stoned Jesus - First Communion
===============================
#Occult

Have you seen the stones from the sky?
Have you heard words that are unspoken?
Have you watched the rivers gone dry?
Have you felt balance is broken?
Fearless wrath and filthy deceit
Bear mighty's Heaven redemption
Those who are lured with wrong pagan creed
Face favor of the God's nation

Now we hide in forests and caves
We are the blasphemous children
Our witchcraft is saving the day
time will come to end kneeling

There will be no resurrection, no Messiah's will
The ones who priest anothers are unholy still
With sacred cross they carry God's name to your home
No witness to their cruelty but cathedral's dome, yeah

Occult 9x

#Red Wine

This beautiful skin you have just drives me insane 
I cannot sleep, cannot eat, and you are to blame 
Your black eyes are cruel but I want you to be mine 
And one of these nights I swear 
I'll drink your red wine, yeah! 

You're crawling behind the trees, I smell your perfume 
Why are you doing this to me, my sister of Doom? 
Your thousand admirers are waiting in line 
But I'll be the first tonight 
To drink your red wine! 

Thorns of rose are no longer sharp 
You know this is time 
To create the tainted potion of 
white milk and red wine 

There's no-one beside you now, you've nowhere to run 
I won't hurt you anymore, my work's almost done 
You were too proud of yourself - that's your only crime 
Now I fill my bottles with Your magic red wine! 

Thorns of rose are no longer sharp 
We know this is time 
To create the tainted potion of 
white milk and red wine, oh yeah


#Black Woods

I, the Wizard of the Night. 
Know all things beyond the light. 
I know every human flaw. 
I watch darkness deadly grows. 

In this darkness, in this gloom. 
Dwells the Master of my Doom. 
If I follow all the rules. 
He will take me to his Black Woods. 
Oh yeah. 

Sun dims slowly like the fire. 
Moon dies in it's funeral pyre. 
All is silent, all beholds. 
As the path to Hell unfolds. 

From the south side side of the sky. 
Without asking reasons why. 
Comes the Master of my Doom. 
Now he's taking me to Black Woods. 
Oh yeah. 

Sun dims slowly like the fire. 
Moon dies in it's funeral pyre. 
I did what I wanted to. 
But forever closed in Black Woods. 
Oh yeah 4x 

Won't somebody tell me what the fuck is going on. 
I think I'm in trouble, I don't know where I belong. 
Soul's teared up in tortures, body's filled with merciless fear. 
I was wrong, it's not my fault, what am I doing here. 
In Black Woods. 

Time to pay the price, to look what you've got for what you sell. 
This place's even worse than burning pits of Bible's Hell. 
You were wrong, you chose your path, too late, it's turn to loose. 
Forever imprisoned in this magic of Black Woods. 
Yeah. 
Yeah!


#Falling Apart

Falling apart we proud. 
We're too close to the sun. 
Heat we felt was so loud. 
Burnt us down to the ground. 

Spiraling down we go. 
From the Sun to the core. 
Drifting in clouds we float on. 
Into the nevermore.
