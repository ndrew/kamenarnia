Stoned Jesus - Seven Thunders Roar
==================================

#Bright Like the Morning

Seven Thunders Roar
Over flooded shore
Pilgrim have you lost your way

Many lands you've seen
Through the lens of green
Now hangover saves the day

Looks like you're still young
Shining like the Sun
But inside you're almost dead

Searching for yourself
On an empty shelf
Magic potions never help, they never help

Bright Like The Morning
She descends from up above
Sweet like my yearning
She's the One for she is Love

Sailing seas of hope
Climbing up the rope
There's a chance to start again

Things to realize
Hiding in disguise
Pilgrim's journey never ends, it never ends

Bright Like The Morning
She descends from up above
Sweet like my yearning
She's the One for she is Love

Cold like the Knowning
She needs patience, she needs time
Bright Like The Morning
She's the One for she is my Love

Seven Thunders Roar
Over flooded shore
Pilgrim have you lost your way


#Electric Mistress

On a silver unicorn
Rides that lady of the storm
Heaven's bliss from up above
She's the queen of all beloved

Electric Mistress casting her spell on me
Electric Mistress helping to let me be
Electric Mistress she knows well what to do
Electric Mistress coming to get me, coming to get me and you

Making love all night long
Going crazy on and on
Finally when morning came
She was gone and I was drained

Electric Mistress casting her spell on me
Electric Mistress helping to let me be
Electric Mistress she knows well what to do
Electric Mistress coming to get me, coming to get me and you

She's coming your way
She's the night, she's the day
She's coming to you
Coming to get me, coming to get me and you

Electric Mistress casting her spell on me
Electric Mistress helping to let me be
Electric Mistress she knows well what to do
Electric Mistress coming to get me, coming to get me and you

#Indian

I'm an Indian
You can tell me by my eyes
I'm an Indian
White people always lies
You brought deceases, hunger and greed
You took our horses, women and seeds
But I'm an Indian
Stepping out on the path of war

I'm an Indian
You will never conquer me
I'm an Indian
Won't falling on my knees
Your stupid gods never help you this way
This is my land and here I stay
'Coz I'm an Indian
Stepping out on the path of war

Why did you do this I don't know
You had to leave, you had to go
Now you're all damned, yes you all cursed
With every day it's getting worse


#I'm the Mountain


Days go by but I don't seem to notice them. 
Just a roundabout of turns. 
All these nights i lie awaken on my own. 
My pale fire hardly burns. 

Ahhhhhhhhh
Ahhhhhhhhh

Never fell in love with the one who loves me.
But with ones who love me not.
Are we doomed to live in grief and misery.
Is it everything we've got?

Ahhhhhhhhh
Ahhhhhhhhh

I'm the mountain, rising high. It's the way that I survive.
I'm the mountain, tell my tale. The greatest story's now for sale.
I'm the seaside, I'm the waves. I'm the one that makes you crave.
I'm the valley, I'm the hills. Look at me im standing still.

I'm the mountain, i'm the plains. tell me now am i insane. 
I'm the spirit, I'm the source. I'm the root I am the doors. 
I'm the road, long and hard. running out of my heart. 
I'm the mountain, climb me up. And we never gonna stop. 

I'm the locker, I'm the key. I am who you want to be.
I'm the reason, I'm the blame. I will never be the same.
Mirror mirror tell the truth of the old ones and the youth.
Of the things we hide deep from ourselves.
Mirror mirror show me now what will I become and how.

For now I'm just a Mountain. 
I'm the Mountain! 

Down the road that leads me to the Headley Grange
I see a figure of a young man
He's torn with doubts, mistakes, his selfishness and rage
But doing all the best he can 

I'm not so blind to see. 
That this young man is....me.


#Stormy Monday

Break of dawn, you're still sleeping
I'm awake and I gotta go
Promises, I never keep 'em
They're just words that you should have known
Gotta go now, leave you there alone on a stormy Monday

I don't want to be yours
There's too much poison in your blood
Let it flow as it goes
Anyway you'll find another stud
The very next day you got one again on a stormy Monday

Wash your soul on a stormy Monday
Keep your dreams deep inside
Watch your step on a stormy Monday
Take me through this endless ride
Don't get drunk on a stormy Monday
You'll find a stranger in your bed
Being alone on a stormy Monday
It's even worse than being dead
